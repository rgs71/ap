## Das elektronische Schulbuch

Für das Fach Informatik wird kein eigenes Schulbuch benötigt. Einige engagierte Lehrerinnen und Lehrer haben aber gemeinsam das *elektronische Schulbuch* für Rheinland-Pfalz erstellt. Die aktuelle Fassung gibt es immer auf der Seite [inf-schule.de](https://www.inf-schule.de).

Dort siehst Du auch einen Überblick über die vielen Aspekte, die der Informatikunterricht abdeckt. 

Den Lehrplan für die Oberstude findest Du auf dem [Bildungsserver](https://static.bildung-rp.de/lehrplaene/gymnasium/Informatik_LP_SekII.pdf).


## Overview

Consistent with the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework, the course’s material is organized around seven so-called “big ideas” as well as six computational thinking practices. The seven big ideas are:
1.	Creativity
2.	Abstraction
3.	Data and Information
4.	Algorithms
5.	Programming
6.	The Internet
7.	Global Impact
<br>

And the six computational thinking practices are:

* P1. Connecting Computing
* P2. Creating Computational Artifacts
* P3. Abstracting
* P4. Analyzing Problems and Artifacts
* P5. Communicating (both orally and in writing)
* P6. Collaborating

## Academic Honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that students submit to this course must be their own. Collaboration on problems is not permitted except to the extent that students may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing thier work for them. Generally speaking, when asking for help, students may show their code to others, but they may not view their peers', so long as they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on the AP Computer Science Principle's through-course assessments, namely the create and explore task, is permitted to the extent prescribed by their description provided by the College Board.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

### Reasonable

* Communicating with classmates about problems in English (or some other spoken language).
* Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.
* Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code in class, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
* Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the snippets' origins.
* Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.
* Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.
* Sharing snippets of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.
* Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problems or your own through-course assessments.
* Whiteboarding solutions to problems with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
* Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

* Accessing a solution in CS50 Vault to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.
* Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem before (re-)submitting your own.
* Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problems.
* Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.
* Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
* Looking at another individual's work during a test or quiz.
* Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
* Providing or making available solutions to problems to individuals who might take this course in the future.
* Searching for, soliciting, or viewing a test or quiz's questions or answers prior to taking a test or quiz.
* Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problems online or elsewhere.
* Splitting a problem's workload with another individual and combining your work, when prohibitted.
* Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed snippets.
* Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
* Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval.
* Using resources during a test or quiz beyond those explicitly allowed in the test or quiz's instructions.
* Viewing another's solution to a problem and basing your own solution on it.
